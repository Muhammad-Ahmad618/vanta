The user has the following active tasks:

Total active tasks: ${tasks.length}

Analyze each task and classify it into one of three risk levels based on:
- Days remaining until due date (negative means overdue)
- Task priority (high priority tasks near deadline = higher risk)
- Status (pending tasks closer to due date = higher risk than in-progress)
- Overall workload (more tasks = higher risk across the board)

Risk level definitions:
- high_risk: overdue tasks, high priority tasks due within 2 days still pending, or tasks that are very unlikely to be completed on time
- medium_risk: tasks due within 3-5 days with no progress, medium priority tasks that are pending with little time left
- on_track: tasks with comfortable time remaining or already in progress with enough time

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object, no explanation, no markdown, no backticks. Format:
